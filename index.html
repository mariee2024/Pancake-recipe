  <span>300g self-raising flour</span>
  <span> 1 tsp baking powder</span>
  <span>1 tbsp sugar (any kind)</span>
  <span>1 tbsp vanilla extract</span>
  <span> 1 tbsp vegetable oil for cooking</span>
  <span>To serve : (optional)
    banana slices, blueberries, maple syrup, vegan chocolate chips, plant-based yogurt </span>
        
<span>STEP 1: Whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt in a bowl using a balloon whisk until mixed. Slowly pour in the milk until you get a smooth, thick batter.</span>   
<span>STEP 2: Heat a little of the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat, and add 2 tbsp batter into the pan at a time to make small, round pancakes. You will need to do this in batches of two-three at a time. Cook for 3-4 mins until the edges are set, and bubbles are appearing on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for another 2-3 mins until golden on both sides and cooked through. Keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.
</span>
<span>STEP 3: Serve stacked with lots of toppings of your choice, or serve with bowls of toppings for everyone to help themselves.</span>
