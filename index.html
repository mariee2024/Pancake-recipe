      <ul style="float: right; min-width: 500px;">
      <li>300g self-raising flour</li>
      <li> 1 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li> 1 tbsp sugar (any kind)</li>
     <li> 1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
       <li> 1 tbsp vegetable oil for cooking</li>
       <li> To serve : (optional)
    banana slices, blueberries, maple syrup, vegan chocolate chips, plant-based yogurt</li>
       <li>STEP 1: Whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt in a bowl using a balloon whisk until mixed. 
         Slowly pour in the milk until you get a smooth, thick batter.</li>
       <li>STEP 2: Heat a little of the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat, and add 2 tbsp batter into the pan at a time to make small, round pancakes. You will need to do this in batches of two-three at a time. 
  Cook for 3-4 mins until the edges are set, and bubbles are appearing on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for another 2-3 mins until golden on both sides and cooked through. Keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.
</li>
     <li> STEP 3: Serve stacked with lots of toppings of your choice, or serve with bowls of toppings for everyone to help themselves.</li>

      </ul>
