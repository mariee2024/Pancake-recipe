<div class="center-justified"> 
  
  <p>
300g self-raising flour</p>
 <p> 1 tsp baking powder</p>
     <p>1 tbsp sugar (any kind)</p>
    <p>1 tbsp vanilla extract</p>
   <p> 1 tbsp vegetable oil for cooking</p>
     <p>To serve : (optional)
       banana slices, blueberries, maple syrup, vegan chocolate chips, plant-based yogurt </p>
        
  <p>STEP 1: Whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt in a bowl using a balloon whisk until mixed. Slowly pour in the milk until you get a smooth, thick batter.</p>   
<p>STEP 2: Heat a little of the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat, and add 2 tbsp batter into the pan at a time to make small, round pancakes. You will need to do this in batches of two-three at a time. Cook for 3-4 mins until the edges are set, and bubbles are appearing on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for another 2-3 mins until golden on both sides and cooked through. Keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining pancakes.
</p>
<p>STEP 3: Serve stacked with lots of toppings of your choice, or serve with bowls of toppings for everyone to help themselves.</p>
